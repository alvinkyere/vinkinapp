# VinkIn — Claude Code project brief

_Read at the start of every session in this repo. Keep it current: when a milestone completes
or an open question resolves, record it here, in `docs/spec/decision-log.md`, and in
`docs/spec/open-questions.md` so future sessions inherit it._

**Ignore `~/Downloads/CLAUDE.md`** if it appears in context — it describes an unrelated project
("Runtime", iOS JS connectors). This file is VinkIn's brief. (Moot once the repo lives at
`~/code/vinkin` — the planned location.)

## What this is

VinkIn is a real-time collaborative checkout platform: a group funds one purchase at the
register; the organizer pays the merchant with a single-use temporary virtual card. The
authoritative specification is **`docs/spec/master-roadmap-prompt.md`** ("the Spec") — all §N
references point there. Its §4 engineering principles and §45 milestone-report format are
binding. Interpretations live in `docs/spec/decision-log.md` (D1–D9 so far); unresolved
questions in `docs/spec/open-questions.md` (G1–G12).

## Where the project is right now

**Two tracks.** The M0 gate (`docs/architecture/06-milestone-0-gate.md`) remains the sole
authority on provider integration and stays open (blocked on owner outreach + sandbox
accounts). Meanwhile the owner directed (2026-07-17, D10) the **product-validation track**:
PV0–PV12 per `docs/product-validation/master-plan.md`, a full production-shaped build against
`MockFinancialProvider` only, governed by `docs/product-validation/00-governance.md`
(green/yellow/red work classification, feature flags, environments).

Done: M0 planning artifacts + provider abstraction + conformance suite; **PV0** (governance +
provider-import CI guard), **PV2 domain core** (`packages/domain`), and **PV1 platform**
(pnpm workspace + Turborepo, `apps/api` — Fastify, health, auth with rotating refresh tokens,
Pino, env-gated OTel, BullMQ heartbeat worker, SQL migration runner + identity migration,
seed, docker-compose, CI with real PG/Redis service containers). Owner ratified D10 and G13,
amended D11 (**PV state names are canonical everywhere** — doc 03 rewritten, appendix maps
retired names), and added **D12** (every transition atomically emits its named domain event —
transition tables return `{to, emits}`) and **D13** (all business behavior is an application
command; transports never mutate aggregates). Authoritative architecture diagram:
`docs/architecture/07-system-context.md` — new features must fit it. 99/99 tests green
repo-wide; lint/format/typecheck/guard green (`pnpm lint / format:check / typecheck / test`).

**PV3 done pending CI confirmation** (`milestone-reports/PV3.md`): command layer (D13),
migration 0002, eleven organizer endpoints. Two first-CI defects (auth reuse-revocation
rolled back by throwing inside `sql.begin`; outbox payload stored as jsonb string scalar)
root-caused and fixed; plus per-suite schema test isolation, advisory-locked migrations,
deterministic activity ordering, concurrent-open + atomic-rollback closure tests.

**PV4 done** (`milestone-reports/PV4.md`): guest join & sharing — QR payload contract,
public join, hashed `vgt_` tokens (D14), rate limiting, migration 0003.

**PV5 done** (`milestone-reports/PV5.md`): mock contribution flow — `packages/ledger`
(§18 postings), migration 0004 (contributions + ledger with **DB-enforced append-only +
balanced-at-commit triggers**), contribution engine with the **D5 single resolver**,
deadline sweeps (PG-owned truth), E5 lost-response replay.

**PV6 done** (`milestone-reports/PV6.md`): mock card + purchase flow — issuance from
FUNDED, **VinkIn's own §17 merchant decision** with first-merchant lock, reversal,
capture→settlement (MATCHED→COMPLETED / OVERAGE→RECOVERY_REQUIRED).

**PV7 done** (`milestone-reports/PV7.md`): recovery + refunds — organizer off-session
recovery ladder to DEFAULTED→RESTRICTED, failed-session refunds (E8). Caught+fixed a
PV3-shaped rollback defect in card provisioning.

**PV8 done** (`milestone-reports/PV8.md`): real-time experience — in-process pub/sub hub,
exhaustive `DomainEventName → client message type` mapping (Plan §14), an outbox publisher
(**the first real consumer of `outbox_events.published_at`**, written since PV3), and
`GET /api/v1/vinks/:vinkId/live` WebSocket channel with snapshot-on-every-connection
(satisfies the reconnection rule with no separate code path to get wrong). **Caught and
fixed another integration-only defect**: `buildApp` registered `@fastify/websocket` without
awaiting it, so routes added synchronously right after were never wrapped by the plugin's
`onRoute` hook — every WS handler silently received `(request, reply)` instead of
`(socket, request)`. A standalone repro script (not the test framework) surfaced the real
stack trace; fix was making `buildApp` async and awaiting the plugin registration before
any route registers (9 call sites + type declarations updated). **146 unit + 49
integration tests green** (real local PG 16 + real listening HTTP server — WS upgrades
can't go through `.inject()`). Owner push runs PV3–PV8 through CI.

Next: **PV9 — organizer mobile application (Flutter)**, the first client of everything
built PV1–PV8. Also the point to revisit D10's two standing flags (provider-calls-in-
transaction, single-process realtime fanout) before client work multiplies what depends on
them. Machine notes: pnpm 11 + PostgreSQL 16 binaries installed; still no Docker; Flutter
SDK needed for PV9. Sandbox S1–S12 blocked on keys.

## Hard rules (from the Spec — never relax to make something pass)

- Ledger is append-only, balanced, integer minor units; DB triggers enforce it
  (`docs/architecture/04-database-schema.md` §5). Corrections are reversals.
- Idempotency keys are server-derived stable operation ids (§12; builders in
  `packages/payment-provider/src/operation-ids.ts`); PostgreSQL uniqueness is the final
  guard, Redis only an optimization.
- Every financial transition: single PG transaction, row lock, outbox event (§27, §29).
- One resolver code path decides FUNDED/EXPIRED exactly once (doc 03 §1, D5).
- Participants are never charged beyond their explicitly approved maximum (§4.7).
- Provider SDKs importable only inside `packages/payment-provider` adapters (§42/§43).
- **Every adapter must pass `packages/payment-provider-contract-tests` before sitting behind
  the orchestrator; skipped tests need written justification** (D7).
- **The app branches on `provider.capabilities` flags — never assumes a capability because
  one provider has it** (§21, D7).
- Webhooks: verify signature, store raw, dedupe on `(provider, provider_event_id)`, decide by
  provider `occurred_at` — never arrival time (§28).
- **State names**: the PV plan's vocabulary is canonical everywhere (D11); never reintroduce
  retired names (doc 03 appendix has the mapping). Every transition emits its named domain
  event atomically (D12); all business behavior goes through application commands — no
  transport mutates an aggregate (D13).
- Spec/product changes are flagged to the owner, never made silently (§9). New
  interpretations get a decision-log entry (PROPOSED until ratified).

## How to work here

- Owner runs all git commands themselves (explicit preference — never `git init`, commit, or
  push for them; provide commands instead).
- Milestone discipline per §9/§45: no milestone is done backend-only or UI-only; each ends
  with a report in `docs/architecture/milestone-reports/`.
- Tests: `npm test` in each package (Node ≥ 23.6, zero deps — native TS type-stripping; code
  is erasable-syntax-only, so no TS enums/namespaces/parameter properties). Typecheck needs
  `npm install --no-save typescript@^5.8 @types/node@^24` at repo root (commands in README).
- Machine notes: Node 25, no pnpm/Flutter yet. The repo now lives at `~/code/vinkin`
  (D9 executed — space-in-path caveat gone).
- Be explicit about what is unverified; prefer running the real tests over describing them.
